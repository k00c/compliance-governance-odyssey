## Practical Projects

### Project 1: Complete Milestone 1 - Regulatory Gap Analysis

**Objective:** Finish the comprehensive gap analysis started in Week 03

**Part 2: Gap Analysis Assessment (Day 5)**

Using the compliance requirements register created in Week 03, assess current compliance status:

1. **Current State Assessment:**
   - For each requirement, determine compliance status:
     - Compliant (controls in place and effective)
     - Partially Compliant (controls exist but inadequate)
     - Non-Compliant (no controls or ineffective)
     - Unable to Assess (insufficient information)

2. **Evidence Evaluation:**
   - Document what evidence exists (or is missing)
   - Note control effectiveness
   - Identify root causes of gaps

3. **Risk Rating:**
   - Assess likelihood and consequence of non-compliance
   - Prioritize gaps using risk matrix
   - Consider regulatory focus areas

4. **Document Findings:**
   - Create findings summary (8-10 key gaps)
   - Include observations and evidence
   - Note areas of good practice (2-3 examples)

**Part 3: Remediation Roadmap (Day 7)**

Develop action plan to address identified gaps:

1. **Prioritization:**
   - High priority: Regulatory deadlines, high risk, safety-critical
   - Medium priority: Important but not urgent
   - Low priority: Minor gaps, low risk

2. **Action Planning:**
   For each gap, document:
   - Specific remediation actions
   - Control type (hierarchy of controls)
   - Responsible party/position
   - Target completion date
   - Resources required
   - Dependencies
   - Success criteria

3. **Implementation Timeline:**
   - Create Gantt chart or timeline view
   - Show quick wins (30 days)
   - Medium-term actions (90 days)
   - Long-term improvements (6-12 months)

4. **Tracking Mechanism:**
   - Design status tracking approach
   - Define review frequency
   - Establish escalation criteria

## Preparation for Week 05

**Topic:** Compliance Auditing Techniques

**Pre-Reading:**
- Introduction to internal auditing standards
- DMIRS inspection and audit approach
- Audit planning fundamentals

**Connection to This Week:**
With understanding of requirements (Week 03), gaps (this week's milestone), and controls (this week), you're ready to learn systematic auditing approaches to verify compliance.

---

## Additional Tips for Success

1. **Think in layers:** Good risk management uses multiple controls
2. **Critical controls:** Identify which controls must never fail
3. **Test assumptions:** Verify that controls actually work as designed
4. **Learn from failures:** Study incidents where controls didn't work
5. **Engage stakeholders:** Involve those who implement controls in design
6. **Document thoroughly:** Clear documentation of control intent and design
7. **Review regularly:** Controls degrade over time without maintenance
8. **Stay practical:** Controls must be feasible and sustainable
