## Additional Tips for Success

1. **Practice writing daily:** Compliance is a writing-intensive field
2. **Create templates:** Build a library of reusable templates
3. **Study real examples:** Collect sample documents from public sources
4. **Think like an auditor:** Ask "could I verify this from the documentation?"
