## The Problem: Too Much Scrolling

### Old Structure - Week 01 Example

```
# Week 01: Risk Management Basics

## Daily Schedule
Day 1: Introduction (2-3 hours)
- Tasks listed here
- But readings are elsewhere...

Day 2: Risk Identification (2-3 hours)  
- More tasks here
- But where are the readings?

Day 3: Risk Assessment (3-4 hours)
- Even more tasks
- Still no readings in sight...

[... need to scroll down ...]

## Readings & Resources (ALL AT BOTTOM)
Essential Reading:
- ISO 31000 (1-2 hrs)
- WA DMIRS Policy (1 hr)
- Textbook Ch. 1-3 (3-4 hrs)
- [Which readings go with which day? Not clear!]

## Courses (SEPARATE SECTION)
- Module 1: Introduction
- Module 2: Identification  
- Module 3: Assessment
- [Which module goes with which day? Not clear!]

## Practical Projects (SEPARATE SECTION)
Project 1: Sample Risk Register
- [Full description here, but when do I do this?]
```

**Problem:** To work on Day 2, you need to:
1. Read Day 2 tasks at the top
2. Scroll down to find relevant readings
3. Scroll to courses section to find relevant modules
4. Scroll to projects to see if there's a project
5. **Result: Confusing and time-consuming!**
