# Weekly Plan Structure Improvement - Summary

## Problem Statement
The weekly plans required too much scrolling to find information. Users had to jump between:
- Daily tasks in one section
- Readings at the bottom of the file
- Course information in a separate section
- Project details scattered throughout
- Resources in different locations

This made it difficult to work through the week day-by-day.

## Solution Implemented

### New Day-by-Day Structure
Each day is now **completely self-contained** with:
1. **Time Allocation** - Expected hours for the day
2. **Tasks** - Checklist of what to do
3. **Readings for Today** - Only the readings needed for this specific day
4. **Course Modules for Today** - Specific modules to complete (if applicable)
5. **Resources for Today** - Links and references needed today
6. **Practice Exercises** - Hands-on activities for today
7. **Key Concepts** - Important definitions and ideas to master
8. **Deliverable for Today** - What to produce and where to save it
9. **Reflection Prompts** - Questions to consider
