## Content Guidelines

When creating or modifying content in this repository:

1. **Use Markdown format** for all documentation files
2. **Follow the day-by-day weekly plan structure** when creating new weekly plans. Each day should be self-contained with all necessary information:
   - **Overview Section:** Brief description, duration, and time commitment
   - **Learning Objectives:** Clear, measurable objectives for the entire week
   - **Day-by-Day Sections:** Each day (Day 1-7) should include:
     - Time allocation for that day
     - Tasks checklist for that day
     - Readings specific to that day (with table format including Resource, Type, Time, Link/Location)
     - Course modules to complete that day (if applicable)
     - Resources specific to that day
     - Practice exercises for that day (if applicable)
     - Key concepts to master that day
     - Deliverable for that day with clear location
     - Reflection prompts for that day (optional)
   - **Weekly Deliverables Summary:** Table showing all deliverables, locations, and due days
   - **Quick Reference Links:** Essential links used throughout the week
   - **Tips for Success:** Practical advice for completing the week
3. **Make each day self-contained:** Users should NOT need to scroll to find readings, resources, or project instructions. Everything needed for that day should be in that day's section.
4. **Reference WA-specific regulations and standards** where applicable, such as:
   - WA Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) guidelines
   - ISO 31000 Risk Management
   - WA Mining Act and Environmental Protection Act
5. **Include practical exercises** that relate to resource sector governance and compliance
6. **Maintain consistency** in terminology and formatting across all documents

## File Naming Conventions
